Qualcomm today announced that its next flagship processor will be called the Snapdragon 845, the company said at its Snapdragon Tech Summit. The 845 is a direct successor to last year’s very popular Snapdragon 835, and it will likely bring improved performance, better power efficiency, and improved image processing. The Snapdragon 845 will likely be found in many high-end Android phones in 2018, though it is also expected to make its way to Windows 10 laptops as well.

Last year’s Snapdragon 835 featured a 10nm manufacturing process, and the 845 is expected to be the same. Qualcomm will pair the 845 with its latest X20 LTE modem, which provides gigabit connectivity on supported networks. Qualcomm is hosting its annual conference this week, where we expect to learn more about the Snapdragon 845 and all of its capabilities, so stay tuned for more.
